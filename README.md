# Python for Data Science 📊🐍

Welcome to my **Python for Data Science** repository! This is where I document and share all the Python projects, exercises, and notes I work on daily while learning data science.

Each day, I add a new folder with Python scripts, Jupyter notebooks, datasets, and explanations to track my progress and practice coding effectively.
